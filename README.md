## Ca_Analysis: Calcium imaging suite for data management, preprocessing, and analysis.

This is the codebase used in the Gavornik Lab for working with imaging data in the [Gavornik Lab](https://gavorniklab.bu.edu/). It handles file management, preprocessing, and common analysis tools. Pipelines and experiment-specific scripts are located in the experiments directory. It is extensible and has been used in a wide variety of project types.

I'm currently in the process of reorganizing and documenting this project to make it useful for others. Stay tuned.
